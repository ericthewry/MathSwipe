# MathSwipe

MathSwipe is a `CoffeeScript` game developed in the context of the [Originate](http://www.originate.com/) 'Intern Hack 2015' Event, presented August 2015.  It is a web-game in which the user is given a grid of numbers (0-9) and operators (&times;, +, -), as well as a set of goal-values.  The user's goal is to swipe a path through the cells to create an expression that evaluates to one of the goal-values. A level is completed when the user finds expressions evaluating to each goal-value.

  "description": "MathSwipe is a CoffeeScript game developed in the context of the Originate 'Intern Hack 2015' Event, presented August 2015. It is a web-game in which the user is given a grid of numbers (0-9) and operators (Ã—, +, -), as well as a set of goal-values. The user's goal is to swipe a path through the cells to create an expression that evaluates to one of the goal-values. A level is completed when the user finds expressions evaluating to each goal-value.",
